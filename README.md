# Etcher scanner

This is not my work, I have just extracted the scanner component from the [etcher-sdk](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/etcher-sdk)

This package is a simple way to get the writtables storage devices available and listen for attach/dettach event.

## Installation

`npm i --save etcher-scanner`

## Usage

You can find an example of the etcher scanner [here](https://github.com/lefuturiste/etcher-scanner/blob/master/examples/fetchAllAndListen.js)
